## Weather App
- A weather app using React Native that provides users with real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- Fetches weather information based on user-input city or by detecting the user's location.
- Displays weather details with a responsive and user-friendly UI, including icons representing weather conditions.
- Implements caching to limit API calls and improve app performance.
- Error handling with custom feedback via toast notifications.
- Used React Native, TypeScript, OpenWeatherMap API, Geolocation API (for location-based
weather updates), and the react native packages/dependencies needed for the app.
